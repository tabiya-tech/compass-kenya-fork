The "module" and "sub module" dimensions that LLM traces are grouped by.

A `TraceModule` is a *suite area* of Compass Connect (Build Your Profile, Job Matching, ...).
A `TraceSubModule` is the named area *within* it that produced the work: the counseling sub-phase
for Build Your Profile.

Both dimensions are human readable, exactly as they read in the Langfuse UI: title case, spaces
rather than underscores, no slugs.

Modules are tagged at their own service entry points.
